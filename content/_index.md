This is my personal website that i am mostly planning to use for blogging. At first I was planning to build a modern designed, clean website visually appealing and it can be a kind of a business card than randomly I saw [Dimden.dev](https://dimden.dev/)'s website, which is I really liked so I just archived that website and I heavily inspired from him while building this one, still it is not finished, going to try update it frequently.

So what is the point of this website? I always like to have a blog, when I was little I was reading some small blogs of people and trying to create mine but never actually did. I belive it is more important today as the new internet became something else from the day when i first became online, this website can be a better social media option for me.
