# Welcome to My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post on my new Hugo website. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you all.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:
- Technology trends
- Programming tutorials
- Personal projects
- Learning experiences

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
